    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <P style="text-align: justify;">Regular studies are like tiny drops in a vast ocean of knowledge. There are many things to learn. We need the right mindset for it. Hobbies help us learn while having fun. They are flexible and don’t have strict rules. Some hobbies, like reading, can be done anywhere. Others, like coding, need more time and skills. If you lack resources, you can seek help. When job hunting, our hobbies can make us stand out. Recruiters want to know about our hobbies to understand us better. Our hobbies show who we are. They reveal our personalities. Even if you’re good at academics, without a hobby, your personality may not shine. So, it’s important to choose a hobby and spend time on it to grow as a person.</P>
